# BTB - Beat The Boredom

This is a game jam entry for the BTB jam. The theme:

OUTDOORS

## Possible Implementations

Indoors / outdoors dichotomy.

- You can only be inside for so long.
- You can only move through doors in one direction.
- Your weapon is a door. You can only punch through doors.
- Metal Gear, but your cardboard box is a door.
- Something portal-y (?).
- Reverse rogue-like. (!!!)
- Space Drift-y Thing: The Great Outdoors (!!!!)

### Reverse Roguelike: Retraite

You are trying to get out of the dungeon instead of into it. You start with a
fully spec'd out character, but have to sacrifice items on each floor to
progress up.

### The Great Outdoors

Your remote mining station is damaged, the oxygen recyclers broke. All you have
is one airlock worth and your personal survival supplies. In real terms: You are
already dead. In other words, you have nothing to lose.

So you fling yourself out of the airlock with nothing but a small maneuvering
thruster and a compressed air harpoon.

You don't have long to live, so you may as well enjoy it: Drift between
asteroids and even some old stations, still stocked with oxygen and fuel.
